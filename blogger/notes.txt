When writing about validates_attachment_content_type for the paperclip gem markdown italicizes several methods containing underscores.
    As of version 4.0, all attachments are required to include a contenttype validation, a filename validation, or to explicitly state that they’re not going to have either. Paperclip raises MissingRequiredValidatorError error if you do not do this. So, we add the validatesattachmentcontent_type line so that our model will validate that it is receiving a proper filetype.

To do that, open the migration file *_sorcery_code.rb file under db/migrate and add make sure your file looks like this:
    should be "*_sorcery_core.rb"
